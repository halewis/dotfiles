2016-01-12 15:47:04	Vaelatern	http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=7155
2016-01-12 15:51:43	maldridge	dang, that's crossing several lines
2016-01-12 16:02:53	Vaelatern	Not even being allowed to not give any information is an option.
2016-01-12 16:03:08	Vaelatern	Sorry. Unclear. It's not an option to opt out of any one question
2016-01-12 16:03:24	maldridge	well the simple solution is you provide bogus results
2016-01-12 16:03:41	Vaelatern	Just say "I'm a virgin" for everything and just ignore the whole thing
2016-01-12 16:04:02	maldridge	if its they try to come after you on screwing up the survey, you sue them for privacy violations (I'm assuming the results are "anonymous")
2016-01-12 16:04:31	phy1729	lol
2016-01-12 16:05:48	Vaelatern	Considering you can't register for classes until you've done it...
2016-01-12 16:05:52	Vaelatern	Just gross
2016-01-12 16:06:01	maldridge	alternatively, its written by a university and I'll bet its vulnurable to a ton of SQL shenanigans
2016-01-12 16:06:22	maldridge	oops, you lost all your tables?  That sucks, guess you'll have to start over now...
2016-01-12 16:06:36	phy1729	I wonder if it's open to the internet
2016-01-12 16:07:15	tailgate	you people need to be thinking blackmail
2016-01-12 16:07:57	maldridge	tailgate: I'm more of the opinion to unrecoverably fuck up someones database and assume they were stupid enough to run it on the main cluster
2016-01-12 16:08:04	maldridge	thus taking out most of the school's operational database
2016-01-12 16:08:19	tailgate	they'll just make another one, and blame oracle
2016-01-12 16:08:38	tailgate	now blackmail, that would actually get the school's attention
2016-01-12 16:08:48	maldridge	tailgate: its been a while since you were in school I'll grant, but what do you think the odds that these places actually have serviceable backups of most of that data?
2016-01-12 16:08:51	maldridge	or any of it for that matter
2016-01-12 16:09:07	maldridge	I'll bet most sites are running it all on a single massive SQL cluster and hoping it never blows up
2016-01-12 16:09:34	tailgate	what I'm saying is that they will start over with the same policy
2016-01-12 16:09:43	tailgate	maybe the data will be gone
2016-01-12 16:10:11	tailgate	(I couldn't read the website, as it is blocked at work)
2016-01-12 16:10:53	tailgate	but they'd start up again with new students. So you would feel good about yourself, maldridge but you'd have accomplished nothing.
2016-01-12 16:11:11	maldridge	tailgate: I think you're missing what I was suggesting
2016-01-12 16:11:32	maldridge	phy1729: its done with a keyed link to an email, but its qualtrics, so take that how you will
2016-01-12 16:11:39	tailgate	delete the sex database?
2016-01-12 16:11:44	maldridge	incredibly skinned qualtrics but qualtrics still
2016-01-12 16:11:53	maldridge	tailgate: I'm referring to hosing the entire cluster
2016-01-12 16:12:17	maldridge	peoplesoft databases, blackboard databases, whatever qualtrics databases they might have
2016-01-12 16:12:22	tailgate	oh. hmm. I might enroll then, would you mind editing my entry
2016-01-12 16:12:33	tailgate	gpa of a billon please
2016-01-12 16:12:49	maldridge	as you say, its probably oracle or something proprietary, and as we saw from http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/
2016-01-12 16:12:58	maldridge	oracle is pretty far gone from the beginning
2016-01-12 16:13:01	tailgate	evreyone uses peoplesoft iirc
2016-01-12 16:13:14	maldridge	well yeah, there really isn't any software that does the same thing
2016-01-12 16:13:34	tailgate	man, IBM should enter that space
2016-01-12 16:13:54	maldridge	what, so we can have one more overblown and shitty people management system?
2016-01-12 16:14:09	maldridge	that is one case where microservices make sense
2016-01-12 16:14:17	tailgate	no, two mutually incompatible overblown and shitty people managment systems!
2016-01-12 16:14:28	maldridge	right, I forgot the IBM way
2016-01-12 16:14:31	tailgate	lol imagine transferring classes
2016-01-12 16:14:33	phy1729	lolz http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/
2016-01-12 16:14:56	maldridge	personally I preferred MS Access
2016-01-12 16:15:12	phy1729	but the comic!
2016-01-12 16:16:00	tailgate	I don't get the link at the bottom
2016-01-12 16:16:09	tailgate	is nosql really the solution?
2016-01-12 16:16:38	phy1729	NEVER*
2016-01-12 16:17:21	tailgate	man, DB/2 didn't make the cut?
2016-01-12 16:17:31	maldridge	DB/2 Isn't a real database!
2016-01-12 16:19:15	tailgate	didn't IBM invent RDBMS?
2016-01-12 16:20:05	tailgate	i kinda feel like we're the adam eating the fruit, tempted by the promise of joins
2016-01-12 16:20:17	maldridge	meh
2016-01-12 16:20:38	tailgate	also, IBM is wayyyy more expensive than oracle
2016-01-12 16:22:47	tailgate	or maybe they couldn't think of a joke. Or maybe DB/2 is actually a good product
2016-01-12 16:23:02	tailgate	that's extremly doubtful from my expriences with it
2016-01-12 16:23:36	maldridge	I think perhaps more accurately IBM is considered largely irrelevant in the field of databases anymore
2016-01-12 16:30:52	tailgate	=(
2016-01-12 16:34:52	tailgate	New startup idea: get malnurioushed brown/black kids and take pictures of rich white people "helping"
2016-01-12 16:35:14	tailgate	for tinder profiles and stuff like this, I bet I could charge $500
2016-01-12 16:36:49	maldridge	...
2016-01-12 16:38:35	joseph	tailgate: Is there any context for that idea?
2016-01-12 16:39:10	maldridge	this is tailgate, probably not
2016-01-12 16:39:11	tailgate	medium article that featured a lot of tinder humanitarians
2016-01-12 16:41:07	tailgate	idk, maybe go a step further and create fake charity trips for rich people
2016-01-12 16:41:32	tailgate	rich people are kept out of the way, feel like they helped, and got photos to impress people
2016-01-12 16:41:39	tailgate	evreyone wins!
2016-01-12 16:42:02	phy1729	except people who actually need it
2016-01-12 16:43:25	tailgate	sometimes you have to stop the bleeding
2016-01-12 16:44:16	tailgate	i'll leave the helping to gates et al
2016-01-12 16:44:49	tailgate	oh, and I'll be employing locals to pretend to be starving africans
